# OpenApi Code Genenrator for Server Stubs and Client Libraries

This is a `build_runner` library meant to be included in the
`dev_dependencies` of your project to allow generating of
dart source files for client and server stubs for
OpenAPI 3.0 schema files (Only yaml is supported right now).

See [directory for an example usage](examples/).

You can also [try out the code generator
right inside your browser](https://hpoul.github.io/openapi_dart/): https://hpoul.github.io/openapi_dart/
